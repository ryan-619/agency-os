# Agency OS — architecture, invariants, commands

Internal operating system for a small application-security agency. Read
[PROMPT.md](PROMPT.md) for the full build spec; this file is the working
summary a session should read first.

**Current state: Phase 0 (Foundation) is complete. Phase 1 has not started.**

---

## 1. The invariants (PROMPT.md §2)

These are not preferences. Violating them creates legal exposure or destroys
the product's value. Where a rule can be expressed in the schema it *is*
expressed in the schema, so that a bug in application code cannot produce a bad
row. `packages/db/test/invariants.test.ts` asserts the database rejects each
one.

### Outreach compliance (§2.1)
- **Cold outreach is email and LinkedIn only.** Voice and SMS are for inbound
  contacts and contacts with a recorded opt-in.
  *Enforced now:* `campaigns_no_auto_send_on_voice_or_sms` — a campaign cannot
  have `auto_send = true` on a `voice` or `sms` channel.
- **Consent is per channel and absence means NO.** `consents` has
  `UNIQUE (contact_id, channel)`, `granted` and `source` are both NOT NULL,
  `consents_source_is_not_blank` rejects an empty or whitespace-only source
  (NOT NULL alone accepts `''`), and no row is ever created by default. There
  is no "unknown" state to misread. Deleting a contact removes their consent
  rows, so a re-imported contact correctly starts from NO.
- **Suppression wins over everything.** `UNIQUE (org_id, kind, value)`, checked
  in the send path — never in the campaign builder. The send path does one
  indexed equality lookup, so `suppressions_value_is_normalised` makes the
  normalised shape a constraint rather than a convention: email and domain must
  be lower-cased and trimmed, phone must be E.164. An unnormalised value cannot
  be stored, so `Stop@Example.com` can never coexist with `stop@example.com` as
  a second, unsuppressed row. `packages/core` gains the matching `normalise()`
  helper in Phase 4; until then the database is what enforces it.
  **Phase 4 obligation:** a suppression insert that fails is an opt-out that was
  never recorded — worse than the bug this constraint replaced. When
  `normalise()` cannot parse an inbound number or address, the send path must
  fail loudly and route it to a human, and must never fall through to sending.
  Every geo the seeded ICP targets is covered by a test in
  `packages/db/test/invariants.test.ts`.
- Quiet hours are stored as wall-clock times and must be evaluated in the
  **recipient's** timezone. *The evaluation lands in Phase 4.*

### Evidence integrity (§2.2)
**The app must never state a finding it did not observe.** Four separate
guards, because one of them alone was not enough:

1. `findings_unobserved_has_no_gap` —
   `(observed AND gap IS NOT NULL) OR (NOT observed AND gap IS NULL)`.
   Makes the two columns agree. On its own this only stops a row from
   contradicting *itself*.
2. `findings_observed_requires_a_successful_scan` (trigger, INSERT **and**
   UPDATE) — a finding may not claim `observed = true` if the scan it hangs off
   has `ok = false`. This is the guard that actually stops the §2.2 scenario:
   a timeout or WAF block becoming "they are missing X". Firing on UPDATE
   matters — otherwise an honest row can be edited into a dishonest one.
3. `findings_a_claimed_gap_carries_evidence` — `gap = true` requires a
   non-empty `evidence` object. §2.2: "Findings carry the raw evidence that
   produced them." A gap with `'{}'` is an unsupported claim.
4. `findings_scan_matches_company_and_org` (composite FK on
   `(scan_id, company_id, org_id)`) — the denormalised `company_id` is what the
   UI reads, so it must agree with the scan. Without it a batch scanner with an
   off-by-one can file one company's evidence under another's name and every
   constraint still passes.

**Not yet enforced — Phase 1 (§8.3):** `findings.stale`. The column, its index
and the 14-day threshold (`freshness.stale_after_days` in the seeded ICP) all
exist, but **nothing writes `stale` yet** and there is no scheduled rescan.
Freshness is derivable today from `scans.ran_at`. Phase 4's draft generator
must not assume a finding is fresh because `stale = false` — every row has
`stale = false` because nothing has ever set it.
- The scanner reads **public pages only**. No port scanning, no probing for
  `.git`, `.env`, admin panels or backups. Every piece of copy in the app must
  describe it as posture review from the outside, not a security test.

### Secrets (§2.3)
- No credential in a source file, a log line, or an agent's context window.
- `connectors.secret_ref` points at an encrypted credential; it never holds one.
- The CLIs strip credentials from their output — `safeTarget()` in
  `packages/db/src/cli.ts` prints `host:port/db` and never the DSN.
- `redact()` in `packages/core` walks nested objects and arrays and blanks any
  value whose **key** looks sensitive; both loggers use it. It is a backstop,
  not the primary defence — it matches on key name only, so a credential under
  an innocuous key (`{ value: 'sk-live-…' }`) still gets through. Do not read
  it as permission to log arbitrary objects. `packages/core/test/redact.test.ts`
  pins that limitation as an explicit test.
- `sendVerificationRequest` deliberately does **not** log the magic-link URL.
  That URL is a bearer credential.

### Irreversible actions need a human (§2.4)
- Anything leaving the building goes through the `approvals` queue unless a
  campaign has `auto_send = true`.
  *Enforced now:* `approvals_decided_has_decider` — a row cannot claim it was
  approved without naming who decided and when.
- *The `canUseTool` gate that blocks on this lands in Phase 2.* That code also
  owns the expiry rule: the schema deliberately does **not** forbid
  `status = 'approved'` with `decided_at > expires_at`, because a stale-tab
  approval should surface as a clean "this request expired" from the decision
  service, not as a constraint violation and a 500.
- **Never set `permissionMode: "bypassPermissions"`.**

## 2. Layout

```
apps/
  web/          Next.js 16 App Router — UI + BFF routes + Auth.js
  agent/        the long-running worker (Phase 2 gives it the query() loop)
packages/
  core/         domain logic. NO I/O, no framework, no database.
  db/           schema, reversible SQL migrations, typed queries, seed
```

`packages/core` has an **empty `dependencies` block on purpose**, and
`packages/core/test/no-io.test.ts` reads the source to prove it imports no
framework, no driver, no Node I/O built-in, and never touches `process.env`.
This is the one architectural rule worth being pedantic about (§3).

Not yet created, because their phase has not arrived (§12 — do not scaffold all
seven phases at once):
`packages/scanner` (Phase 1), `packages/tools` (Phase 2), `apps/voice`
(Phase 6, and only after A2P 10DLC registration clears).

### What lands in `packages/core`, and when
| Phase | Domain rules |
|---|---|
| 0 ✅ | authorisation — `can(principal, capability)` |
| 1 | scoring, tiering, disqualifiers, the `observed` rule |
| 2 | risk classification for the approval gate (§5.4) |
| 4 | consent, suppression, quiet hours, daily caps — the one send path |

---

## 3. Commands

```bash
npm install
npx tsc --build          # typecheck + compile packages to dist/
npm test                 # 80 tests: domain + migrations + invariants + seed
npm run build            # packages, then the Next app

# database (needs DATABASE_URL)
npm run db:migrate            # apply pending
npm run db:migrate -- status  # what is applied
npm run db:migrate -- down 1  # revert one
npm run db:migrate -- reset   # all the way down, then up (refuses in production)
npm run db:seed               # org + owner + ICP + 16 seed companies; idempotent

# the whole stack
cp .env.example .env
# set AUTH_SECRET: openssl rand -base64 32
docker compose up --build
docker compose run --rm migrate
docker compose run --rm seed
# app        http://localhost:3000
# magic links http://localhost:8025   (Mailpit — dev only, relays nothing)
```

`packages/core` and `packages/db` compile to `dist/` and are consumed as
JavaScript, so **run `npx tsc --build` after changing them** or the web app
will use stale output. TypeScript project references handle the ordering.

## 4. Decisions and deviations

Places where this repo departs from a literal reading of PROMPT.md, and why.
Flagged rather than hidden, per §13.

**`companies.domain` and `agent_defs.slug` are unique per org, not globally.**
§4 says `domain unique`. A global unique domain would force exactly the
migration that putting `org_id` on every table was meant to avoid, so both are
`UNIQUE (org_id, <col>)`.

**Enumerated columns are `text` + `CHECK`, not Postgres `ENUM` types.**
Verified on a real server: `ALTER TYPE ... DROP VALUE` fails outright
("dropping an enum value is not implemented") and a value added by
`ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` cannot be used in the transaction that added it.
An enum migration is therefore not reversible, and §10 requires every migration
to be. A `CHECK` drops and re-adds cleanly inside one transaction.

**Migrations are hand-written `NNNN_name.up.sql` / `.down.sql` pairs** applied
by `packages/db/src/migrator.ts`, not by drizzle-kit. drizzle-kit generates
forward-only SQL and there is no `drizzle-kit down`. Use
`npx drizzle-kit export --dialect=postgresql --schema=packages/db/src/schema.ts`
as a *generator* if you want a starting point, then hand-maintain the pair.
The migrator records a sha256 over the up **and** down SQL of every applied
migration and **refuses to run if a shipped migration was edited** (§10) — an
edited down file is as dangerous as an edited up file, because `migrateDown`
removes the ledger row on the strength of whatever it does. It also refuses a
migration that issues its own BEGIN/COMMIT, which would silently void the
all-or-nothing guarantee (the plpgsql `BEGIN` that opens a function body is
correctly ignored).

**Two sources of truth, kept in step by a test.** The migrations own the
database; `packages/db/src/schema.ts` owns the types.
`packages/db/test/schema-parity.test.ts` migrates a real Postgres engine from
zero and compares every table, column and nullability against the drizzle
declarations, so drift fails CI instead of production.

**Mailpit is in the default compose stack.** §3's stack table does not mention
it. Phase 0 promises that `docker compose up` gives a working login, and a
magic link has to go *somewhere*; logging it would violate §2.3. It is dev-only,
relays nothing, and production points `SMTP_*` at the real mailboxes instead.

**Tests run on PGlite; CI also runs on real Postgres 16.** PGlite is an
embedded Postgres, so `npm test` needs no Docker and no server. But **PGlite
0.5.8 embeds Postgres 18.3, not 16** — it is a *looser* gate than production,
and will accept PG17/PG18-only syntax that PG16 rejects. The `postgres16` job
in CI runs the same migrations against a real `postgres:16-alpine` and is the
one that actually proves the deploy target. `freshDb()` pins PGlite to UTC;
without that it derives an `Etc/GMT±N` zone from the host clock and truncates
to whole hours (a developer at +05:30 silently tests at +05:00).

**The Dockerfiles copy the ROOT `node_modules` only.** npm workspaces hoist
every dependency to the root and symlink the workspaces as
`node_modules/@agency/* -> ../../packages/*`. There are no per-package
`node_modules` directories, so a `COPY --from=deps /app/packages/db/node_modules`
fails outright. The agent runner then re-runs
`npm ci --omit=dev --workspace @agency/agent --include-workspace-root`, which
needs *every* workspace package.json present to satisfy the lockfile — that is
why the image copies four package.json files it does not otherwise use.

**The web app's database client is lazy (`getDb()`, not a `db` const).**
`next build` evaluates route modules while collecting page data, so anything
done at import time runs during the *build*. Constructing the pool eagerly
called `env()`, which throws on a missing `DATABASE_URL` — and the Docker build
therefore failed with `Failed to collect page data for /api/health` unless
production secrets were passed to `docker build`. An image build must not need
runtime credentials. CI builds the web app with no secrets in the environment
to keep it that way. Never call `env()` or `getDb()` at module scope.

**Sign-in reveals nothing about who has access.** Membership is checked inside
`sendVerificationRequest`, not by returning `false` from the `signIn` callback.
Refusing in the callback makes @auth/core throw `AccessDenied`, which redirects
somewhere visibly different from the success path — a clean oracle that turns a
guessed address list into the exact roster worth phishing. Now a stranger and a
team member get byte-identical responses and only the member gets mail. The
callback still refuses on the *callback* leg, which is what enforces "no signup
flow" (§1).

**`AUTH_URL` is required and `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` is tri-state.** Auth.js reads
`process.env.AUTH_URL` itself, so a zod `.default()` made the variable look
configured while Auth.js fell back to the request Host header — with
`trustHost` on, that lets a forged header choose the origin the magic link
points at. And @auth/core assigns `config.trustHost ??= …`, so passing an
explicit `false` beats its own default and every request fails `UntrustedHost`,
including in development; the config key is therefore omitted entirely when the
variable is unset.

**`users.email` is stored normalised, enforced by `users_email_is_normalised`.**
@auth/core lower-cases the sign-in identifier before any lookup and
@auth/drizzle-adapter then matches `users.email` *exactly*. A row stored as
`Priya@Agency.com` would be invisible to that lookup, so Auth.js would try to
create a second user and fail on `org_id NOT NULL` — locking the person out
with an opaque error. Storing only the normalised form makes the gate and the
adapter agree by construction.

**`/api/health` is unauthenticated and hits the database.** Deliberate — an
orchestrator has to reach it — and it reports only `err.name`, never the driver
message that would carry the DSN. It is not rate limited, so sustained
anonymous traffic can occupy connections from the same pool the app uses;
`DATABASE_POOL_MAX` exists partly so that ceiling is tunable. Rate limiting
belongs with the reverse proxy in front of the VPS, not in the app.

**`users.org_id` is NOT NULL with no default**, so the Auth.js adapter's
`createUser` cannot succeed. That is deliberate: there is no signup flow (§1).
The `signIn` callback refuses any address without a `users` row *before* mail is
sent, and the NOT NULL is the backstop if that callback is ever bypassed.

---

## 5. SDK verification (PROMPT.md §13)

§13 asks for the SDK option names to be checked against the installed package's
own types and any drift noted here. Checked against
**`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.3.263`**.

**Names that are correct as written in the spec:** `query`, `mcpServers`,
`agents`, `canUseTool`, `resume`, `forkSession`, `includePartialMessages`,
`maxTurns`, `maxBudgetUsd`, `settingSources`, `skills`, `createSdkMcpServer`,
`tool`, `sessionStore`, `permissionMode`, `systemPrompt`, `allowedTools`,
`hooks`. `mcpServers` is `Record<string, McpServerConfig>` and the stdio /
http / sse shapes match §6's `buildMcpServers` exactly.

**Drift — §5.4's pseudocode does not match the real types. Phase 2 must use
the real ones:**

1. `canUseTool` is **not** `(toolCall) => ...`. It is
   ```ts
   type CanUseTool = (
     toolName: string,
     input: Record<string, unknown>,
     options: { signal: AbortSignal; suggestions?: PermissionUpdate[]; blockedPath?: string; decisionReason?: string },
   ) => Promise<PermissionResult | null>
   ```
2. `PermissionResult` is **not** `{ allow: boolean, reason }`. It is
   ```ts
   | { behavior: 'allow'; updatedInput?: Record<string, unknown>; updatedPermissions?: PermissionUpdate[] }
   | { behavior: 'deny'; message: string; interrupt?: boolean }
   ```
   So §5.4's `return { allow: true }` becomes `return { behavior: 'allow' }`,
   and the denial becomes
   `{ behavior: 'deny', message: 'Not approved by a human (...)' }`.
3. `AgentDefinition.tools` — passing `'Skill'` here is **deprecated**; use the
   separate `skills` field. Affects §6's skills guidance and §7's `allowedTools`.
4. `SettingSource` is `'user' | 'project' | 'local'`, so §6's
   `settingSources: ["project"]` is right.

**Other pinned-version facts worth not rediscovering:**
- `next-auth@5.0.0-beta.32` peers `next ^14 || ^15 || ^16` — Next 16 is fine.
- Use `next-auth/providers/nodemailer`; `providers/email` is deprecated and
  gives the provider id `email`, changing the callback path.
- `Nodemailer({...})` **throws without a `server` config** even when
  `sendVerificationRequest` is fully overridden.
- Under `strategy: 'database'` the `session` callback receives
  `{ ...adapterSession, user }` — returning it verbatim **publishes the raw
  `sessionToken`** from `GET /api/auth/session`. Build the object explicitly.
- Next 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`; `proxy.ts` runs on the Node
  runtime (`middleware.ts` was Edge). Shipping both is a build error.
- Next 16 dropped the `eslint` key from `next.config`.
- `pg-boss@12.30.0` (Phase 2): **no default export** (`import { PgBoss }`),
  `boss.work` handlers receive an **array** of jobs, and `createQueue()` is
  mandatory before `send`/`work`.

---

## 6. Standards (PROMPT.md §10)

- TypeScript strict, plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. No surviving `any`.
- Zod at every boundary — env is validated at startup in both apps.
- Domain rules in `packages/core`, pure, unit-tested against edge cases.
- Every migration reversible. **Never edit a shipped migration** — the migrator
  will refuse to run, on either half of the pair.
- `npm run typecheck` covers the shipped packages *and* the test suite
  (`tsconfig.test.json`). The test suite is the stated proof of the §2
  invariants, so it belongs inside the type system.
- Structured JSON logging. Never log credentials or full message bodies.
- Conventional commits, small PRs, one phase per branch.
